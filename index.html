            <h2>Becoming a web developer</h2>
            <p>Deciding to become a website developer near the end of my undergrad life was not an easy decision to
                make. There were a lot of comlications and management issue. While I was learning the entire development
                side, I was also learning a lot of other life-skills unknowingly. Now, I am ready to take on this
                challenge head on!</p>
