            <h2>Becoming a web developer</h2>
            <p>Deciding to become a website developer near the end of my undergrad life was not an easy decision to
                make. There were a lot of comlications and management issue. While I was learning the entire development
                side, I was also learning a lot of other life-skills unknowingly. Now, I am ready to take on this
                challenge head on!</p>

                <p>In a year time, I have made around 200+ websites and I am still working on various projects. I have
                    completely mastered HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. Afterwards I went beyond and learned different
                    frameworks like Django, VUE, Node. I am still hungry for more and my only priority is to make a
                    website
                    as streamlined and as efficient as possible.</p>

                <p>I have been struggling with academics, trying to make sense of my life. One wday I stumbled upon a
                    piece
                    of HTML code and I got interested. Now I can make clean websites using HTML and CSS. It is very fun!
                    I
                    think I will become a great developer as I am so good at it. It is very easy work for me and I know
                    I
                    will be great one day if I stick to it! I am determined to be the very best!</p>
